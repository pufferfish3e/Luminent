# Luminent
A web platform that turns raw ideas into investor-ready startup concepts. Built for students, hackathon teams, and first-time founders, IdeaForge uses real data, AI competitor analysis, and guided validation to bridge the gap between concept and viable product â€” not an AI idea generator, but a true innovation engine.
